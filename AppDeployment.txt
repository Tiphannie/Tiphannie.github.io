-During the development phase, a local/private database is used.

-This local database is only accessible to developers.

-For deployment, a remote/public database must be used.

-A remote database allows external users to access their own data.

-This makes the app accessible outside the local environment.

-Performance optimization: Remote databases should be optimized for scalability and performance, especially when handling many users at once.
